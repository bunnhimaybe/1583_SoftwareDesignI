## 1 - Formatting and Format Specifiers

Using printf with different format specifiers was really useful to efficiently print text. I don't think we experimented with spacing, which I think would be really useful and important. I like aligning text and decimals and to make my programs neat.

## 2 - Textbook Exercises

The concept exercises from the textbook help me consolidate the information we've learned about. The case studies are also useful, like the Craps program in Chapter 5. It would be fun and useful to work through these in class or for homework to get hands-on experience. Exercism is also something I wanted to play around with more, but haven't had the time to. 

## 3 - Shadowing

It's hard to keep track of local variables and their scopes. I saw the example where the main variable 'x' was shadowed when we use an 'x' variable in different method calls. It seems like the methods execute at runtime, so using the variable within the main body will conserve its original value. I understood it in the reading, but in practice I think it's a bit confusing. 

## 4 - Practice with Operators

Familiarizing ourselves with the different operators and their associativity would help us gain a stronger understanding and increase our confidence in solving practical problems. I think practicing and manipulating data would be the most efficient way to learn operator precedence and associativity. Even though we know what they do on paper, sometimes we get unexpected outcomes because we didn't anticipate the order of operations. I don't think we've used many post-/pre-fix operators, so working problems that require different kinds of operators would be challenging and helpful.

## 5 - Objects and Classes

Chapter 5 listed a bunch of Java API packages for different purposes that I thought were interesting. Maybe we could go through some of the other classes in java.util, java.util, and java.time. I would also like to work through some more situations where we need to use enum; I think I understand the concept, but I'm not super confident. Is enum a java.lang class type? My understanding is that we can create our own data types that store constants when we define enum. Some more clarification would be useful.
